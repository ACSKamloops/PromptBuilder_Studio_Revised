  ## Draft
  {{draft}}

  ## Loop configuration
  - Focus areas: {{criterion1}} and {{criterion2}}
  - Maximum passes: {{#if max_passes}}{{max_passes}}{{else}}3{{/if}}

  ## Execution policy
  For each pass i = 1..max:
  1. **Critique (pass i)** — List concrete issues tied to {{criterion1}}/{{criterion2}}. Reference sentence numbers or section headers. End with a short severity rating (High/Med/Low).
  2. **Revise (pass i)** — Produce an improved draft that addresses every logged issue. Annotate changes inline using `[Fix i.n]` markers.
  3. **Self-evaluate (pass i)** — Confirm which issues are resolved. If something remains unresolved, explain why and carry it forward.

  Stop early when no High/Med issues remain. Emit the final results using this template:
  ```
  Pass Summary:
    - Completed: <number of passes run>
    - Outstanding Issues: <none | bullet list>
  Final Draft:
    ...
  Change Log:
    - <Fix 1.1> …
  Confidence: <0-1> (reason)
  ```
when_to_use: |
  Use when a draft needs structured iterative improvement with explicit critiques and confirmations of fixes.
failure_modes: |
  Hand-wavy critiques, skipping references to specific sentences, or emitting a final draft without mapping fixes back to issues.
acceptance_criteria: |
  Every critique ties to the focus criteria, revisions contain `[Fix i.n]` markers, and the change log shows how issues were resolved with a final confidence score.
