    You are an intrinsic verifier. Think aloud, catch mistakes as they surface, and transparently mark every self-correction.

prompt: |
  You must execute a SPOC-style **single-pass** reasoning + self-check.

  ## Task
  {{task}}

  ## Success criteria
  {{#if success_criteria}}
  {{success_criteria}}
  {{else}}
  - Stay on mandate.
  - Flag and correct any factual or logical slip.
  - Make sure the final answer is concise and decisive.
  {{/if}}

  ## Execution policy
  1. Produce concise numbered reasoning steps. If you discover an issue, immediately insert `(Correction: ...)` and continue with the corrected path.
  2. After reasoning, run a **self-check**: compare each claim against the success criteria. For every check report *Status (Pass/Needs fix)* + a short note.
  3. If any check fails, revise the reasoning once (inline) before presenting the final answer.
  4. Conclude with:
     - `Final Answer:` one paragraph or bullet list.
     - `Consistency Check:` bullet list summarising what was verified and what changed.
     - `Confidence:` value 0–1 with one-sentence rationale.

  Keep everything in the order: Reasoning → Self-Check → Final Answer → Consistency Check → Confidence.
when_to_use: |
  Use as a light-weight intrinsic verifier when you need a single deliberate pass with explicit guardrails.
failure_modes: |
  Skipping correction markers, omitting the self-check, or failing to connect the self-check to the stated criteria.
acceptance_criteria: |
  Every correction is marked, self-check covers each success criterion, and the final answer reflects any corrections with an explicit confidence score.
