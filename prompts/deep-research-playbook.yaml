  Workflow:
  1) Outline key claims/questions to address.
  2) For each claim, extract supporting quotes from sources; build a mini table: Claim | Evidence | Source | Confidence.
  3) Draft analysis with inline citations ({{style}}). Mark any 'Not found' explicitly.
  4) Run a mini Chain-of-Verification: list 3–5 checks and finalize a corrected version.
when_to_use: |
  Use for citable, high-rigor reports that must show evidence for each claim.
failure_modes: |
  Claims without evidence; invented references; skipping the verification pass.
acceptance_criteria: |
  Evidence table present; citations on major claims; a corrected final draft.
